# Social-Buzz-Analytics
## This project is part of Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Experience.

Social Buzz is a large social media platform that emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions to every piece of content. The main objective was to help the company with its huge amount of data. social Buzz has reached a huge scale in recent years to become recognized as a global unicorn company. At Accenture, we have embarked on a 3-month pilot to help tackle their biggest challenges on 3 main tasks:

1. An Audit of their big data practice.
2. Recommendations for a successful IPO.
3. An analysis of all the above recommendations is made for the growth strategy of Social Buzz.
